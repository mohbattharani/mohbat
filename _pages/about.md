I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute [RPI](https://www.rpi.edu) in New York working under the supervion of Professor [Mohammad J. Zaki](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/). My Ph.D. work is focused on multi-modal models, retrieval augmented generation, visually rich document understanding and diffusion models. My expertise spans scene understanding, model compression, image localization, and autonomous vehicle control. Proficient in various programming languages and frameworks, I'm driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of document AI and scene understanding through innovative research.

# I bring a rich blend of academic and industrial experience to the computer vision and deep learning domain. I am a senior member of IEEE. My educational journey began with a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from [Gachon University](https://www.gachon.ac.kr/sites/eng/)in Seoul, South Korea, where I focused on personalized multimedia generation for resource-constrained devices at the Multimedia Computing Systems Laboratory (MCSLab) under the guidance of [Prof. Eun-Seok Ryu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zWkXcPIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I further honed my skills with a Master of Science in Computer Science from [Indus University](https://www.indus.edu.pk/) and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [COMSATS Institute of Information Technology](https://lahore.comsats.edu.pk/default.aspx) in Pakistan. As a specialized computer vision researcher, I excel in utilizing deep learning techniques for visual analysis, multimedia retrieval, and image processing. I am dedicated to advancing computer vision and deep learning in academic and industrial settings.
