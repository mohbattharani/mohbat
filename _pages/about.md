I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu) in New York working under the supervion of Professor [Mohammad J. Zaki](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/). My Ph.D. work is focused on multi-modal models, retrieval augmented generation, visually rich document understanding and diffusion models. My expertise spans scene understanding, model compression, image localization, and autonomous vehicle control. Proficient in various programming languages and frameworks, I'm driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of document AI and scene understanding through innovative research.
